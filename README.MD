# Book Lits üìö

First project using GraphQL and Apollo. This project is a simple book list app that allows users to add books and authors to a list. The backend is written in Golang Chi.

- GraphQL
- Apollo
- Golang
- React

### Thoughts on the project:

- GraphQL took a while to setup but once the resolvers were in place, you will basically never have to touch the backend again.
- Apollo with typescript is ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Go Chi makes it easy for routing.
- I need to learn more about cors.
